# Contributing
Contributors are welcome. Here's how you can help:

## Creating an issue
- Why did you opened the issue? What is the reason?
- You must explain clearly the issue you are encountering.
- If it's a feature request, think on it if it's needed.
- You **must** be polite (while commenting on or opening an issue).
- Review your issue before opening it.
- Off-topic is not allowed.

## Creating a pull request
- First, think on it if it's need before opening a pull request.
- Explain clearly what it does, and what does it change.
- Why this is needed? Does it fix issues? Does it adds new features?
- You must create a new branch for your new features/bugfixes.
- You **must** be polite (while commenting on or opening a pull request).
- Review before opening the pull request (if it has any issues, etc.).
- You must enable the checkbox "Allow edits from maintainers".
- Off-topic is not allowed.

## For collaborators
- You must not close a pull request/issue without a good reason.
- You must be polite while requesting changes, or reviewing or closing a pull request/issue.
- Review the pull request before merging it. If unsure, ask other collaborators, or the owner.
- Create a pull request if you want to add new features (with a new branch).
- Approve pull request before merge if it looks correct.
